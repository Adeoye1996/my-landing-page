Maze Game README.md
Inspiration
I've always been fascinated by maze games and the challenge of navigating through a complex labyrinth. As a programmer, I wanted to create a game that would test my skills and push me to learn new concepts. This project was born out of that desire, and I'm excited to share my journey with you.
Technical Challenge
My goal was to create a maze game that would generate random mazes, allow player movement, and detect collisions. I chose to use C and SDL for this project, as I wanted to improve my skills in these areas. The biggest technical challenge I faced was implementing the maze generation algorithm, which required me to learn about recursive backtracking and graph theory.
Algorithm Details
I used a recursive backtracking algorithm to generate the maze. This algorithm starts with an empty grid and recursively carves a path through the cells, creating a perfect maze. I implemented this algorithm using a depth-first search approach, which allowed me to efficiently generate mazes of varying sizes.
Solution Details
To detect collisions, I used a simple collision detection algorithm that checks for intersection between the player and the maze walls. I also implemented player movement using arrow keys, which required me to handle keyboard input and update the player's position accordingly.
Timeline
This project took me about 6 weeks to complete, working on it part-time. Here's a rough timeline of my progress:
Week 1: Set up the project and implemented basic SDL functionality
Week 2: Implemented maze generation algorithm and collision detection
Week 3: Added player movement and keyboard input handling
Week 4: Refactored code and optimized performance
Week 5: Added scoring and game over screen
Week 6: Polished the game and wrote this README.md
Next Iteration
For the next iteration of this project, I envision adding more features, such as power-ups, enemies, and multiple levels. I'd also like to improve the graphics and add audio effects to enhance the gaming experience.
Conclusion
I hope you enjoyed reading about my maze game project! I learned a lot from this experience, and I'm proud of what I've accomplished. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
